Market basket analysis is a technique used in data mining and machine learning to analyze patterns of items that are frequently purchased together by customers. It is also known as association analysis or affinity analysis.

The goal of market basket analysis is to identify relationships between items that are purchased together and to use this information to improve sales and marketing strategies. For example, if a supermarket knows that customers who buy milk are also likely to buy bread, they can strategically place these items near each other in the store to encourage additional purchases.

Market basket analysis works by examining transaction data to identify sets of items that are frequently purchased together. This is done by calculating measures such as support, confidence, and lift for each itemset. The support measures the frequency of an itemset, the confidence measures the probability that an item B is purchased given that item A is purchased, and the lift measures the strength of the association between item A and item B.

Market basket analysis can be used in a variety of industries, including retail, e-commerce, and hospitality. It can help companies optimize product placement, develop targeted marketing campaigns, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
