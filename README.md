# Market Basket Analysis
Market basket analysis is a technique used in data mining and machine learning to analyze patterns of items that are frequently purchased together by customers. It is also known as association analysis or affinity analysis.

The goal of market basket analysis is to identify relationships between items that are purchased together and to use this information to improve sales and marketing strategies. For example, if a supermarket knows that customers who buy milk are also likely to buy bread, they can strategically place these items near each other in the store to encourage additional purchases.

Market basket analysis works by examining transaction data to identify sets of items that are frequently purchased together. This is done by calculating measures such as support, confidence, and lift for each itemset. The support measures the frequency of an itemset, the confidence measures the probability that an item B is purchased given that item A is purchased, and the lift measures the strength of the association between item A and item B.

Market basket analysis can be used in a variety of industries, including retail, e-commerce, and hospitality. It can help companies optimize product placement, develop targeted marketing campaigns, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

# What is Apriori algorithm?
Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm used for market basket analysis, which is a data mining technique for discovering associations or correlations among items in a transactional database. The Apriori algorithm was introduced by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994.

The Apriori algorithm is based on the concept of frequent itemsets, which are sets of items that appear frequently together in transactions. The algorithm works by first identifying all frequent itemsets of size 1, then generating candidate itemsets of size 2 by joining frequent itemsets of size 1. The candidate itemsets are then pruned based on their support, which is the number of transactions containing the itemset. This process is repeated to generate frequent itemsets of size 2, then size 3, and so on, until no more frequent itemsets can be generated.

The Apriori algorithm uses a key measure called support, which is the proportion of transactions that contain a particular itemset. The algorithm applies a minimum support threshold, which determines the minimum frequency of occurrence required for an itemset to be considered frequent. This threshold helps to reduce the number of itemsets that need to be considered and speeds up the process of finding frequent itemsets.

The Apriori algorithm also uses the concept of association rules, which are rules that describe relationships between itemsets. Association rules have two parts: an antecedent (a set of items) and a consequent (another set of items). The confidence of an association rule is the proportion of transactions that contain the antecedent and consequent together, divided by the proportion of transactions that contain the antecedent alone. The lift of an association rule is the ratio of the observed support to the expected support if the antecedent and consequent were independent.

The Apriori algorithm is widely used in market basket analysis and other applications of data mining and machine learning. It is implemented in various programming languages and data mining software packages.
